# Welcome to the DankPods API! üì±

Hello! This is a fun, experimental REST API which will return some fancy dankpods quotes.

# üôå GET those quotes

To get a quote, simply send a GET request from the following URI: `GET http://localhost:8080/dank`

# ‚ùî How can I send these requests?

Check out the [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) API client for an intuitive way to interface with this API.

I personally make use of Insomnia.

# How can I contribute to development?

## To get your local development environment set-up:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/SavvyDev06/dankpods-api.git`
2. Install the npm packages: `npm i`
3. Create a `.env` file to store your MongoDB Atlas Database secrets: `MONGODB-DB-UNAME` and `MONGODB-DB-PASS` (make sure you create a MongoDB Atlas cluster first).
4. Run `npm run dev` to launch the development server.

## To contribute:

1. Create a pull request ([read more here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request))

### More documentation to come once I (hopefully) finish this thing.
