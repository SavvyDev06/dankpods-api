# Welcome to the DankPods API! 📱

Hello! This is a fun, experimental REST API which will return some fancy dankpods quotes.

# 🙌 GET those quotes

To get a quote, simply send a GET request from the following URI: `GET http://localhost:8080/dank`

# ❔ How can I send these requests?

Check out the [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) API client for an intuitive way to interface with this API.

I personally make use of Insomnia.

## More documentation once I (hopefully) finish this thing.
